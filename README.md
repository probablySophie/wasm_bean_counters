# Bean Counters - But make it WASM
 

Remaking the game [Bean Counters](https://clubpenguin.fandom.com/wiki/Bean_Counters) using [Rust WASM](https://www.rust-lang.org/what/wasm) and JavaScript, but not NodeJS.


#### Steps to Completion  
- [x] Get a box moving like the penguin does  
- [x] Get objects flying from the right of the screen like they should  
- [x] Catch them!!  
- [ ] Collecting bags for points!  
- [ ] Levels!  
- [x] Text with the points & stuff  
- [ ] Make a penguin image  
- [ ] Get it to move nicely  
- [ ] Make more penguin images  
- [ ] Make the player object able to display different images / frames  
- [ ] Make images for the flying things  
- [ ] Have them rotate slightly? (or change image to look like they're rotating?)  
- [ ] A cute background  
- [ ] Make it possible to choose the penguin's colour  

#### The GitHub Pages page!
- [ ] Get the front page to auto-link to the most recent build  
- [ ] Catppuccin colours?  

#### Dependencies

The Rust `wasm32` target.
```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown # This installs almost instantly
```

The `wasm` build thingamys we use
```bash
# This set of installs *may* slow down your computer for a little while
# While they're thinking about things
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli
cargo install wasm-gc
cargo install wasm-opt
```

The Rust [http crate](https://crates.io/crates/https) that I'm using as a local test server
```bash
# There's something going on between the crate and Cargo that leads to this nightmare of an install command
RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1 cargo install --git https://github.com/thecoshman/http
```
